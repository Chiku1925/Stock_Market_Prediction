# Stock Market Prediction Using LSTM
This project utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict future stock prices. By analyzing historical stock data, the model forecasts stock prices for the next 30 days. This project is ideal for demonstrating time-series forecasting techniques.
## Features
* Time-Series Analysis: Prepares historical stock market data for forecasting.
* LSTM Model: Builds and trains an LSTM model for stock price prediction.
* 30-Day Forecast: Generates predictions for the next 30 days.
* Data Visualization: Plots predicted prices alongside actual historical prices.
